TO FIND THE PATHS BETWEEN STATION X AND Y, RUN COMMAND:

path(X,Y).




There are a lot of paths between two stations and as far as i have checked my program returns all the distinct paths correctly
Example : from aiims to iitDelhi, there are around 1000 possible distinct paths, i am positive that any two stations will have similar or more number of paths since all the cycles are possible in the graph.


You can run any two stations, If found any discrepancy in the path, I can assure you that it is only because of some discrepancy in my database, it might be the case that there are spelling difference of same station in different lines. I myself had found a few discrepencies in output paths but all those were resolved only by correcting some blunder spelling mistakes in the database.
For example, i faced problems because "peeraGarhi" and "peeragarhi" were typed at two different places. Only similar problems will affect the output.




If by chance you find path discrepancy in your example, i strongly suggest you to please try various other stations.


SAMPLE OUTPUT :


 aiims,greenPark,[Yellow->Magenta]hauzKhas,iitDelhi,
true ;


Here, [YELLOW -> MAGENTA] Change happens at hauzKhas.
